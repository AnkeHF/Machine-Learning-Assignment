# Stroke Prediction (Machine Learning Assignment)

## Overview

This repository contains the final assignment for a machine learning course, focusing on the prediction of strokes using machine learning algorithms and Python's `scikit-learn` library. The goal of this assignment was to demonstrate the knowledge gained during the course through a structured approach that includes extensive data analysis and model implementation.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the **Stroke Prediction Dataset (2021)**. It contains 12 variables representing both health and socio-economic factors relevant to stroke prediction.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into several key steps to guide the machine learning pipeline from data exploration to model evaluation. Each step is crucial to ensure a robust and accurate prediction model.

### Steps:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visual and extensive analysis of the dataset to uncover patterns, outliers, and relationships between variables.
  
2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling features, and splitting the data into training and test sets.

3. **Model Selection Justification**
   - Selecting appropriate machine learning models based on the characteristics of the data and the problem at hand.

4. **Model Training, Adaptation, and Evaluation**
   - Training three different models: 
     - Logistic Regression
     - RandomForest
     - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   - Applying oversampling techniques to address class imbalance.
   - Performing feature selection to optimize model performance.
   - Hyperparameter tuning to improve accuracy and generalization.

5. **Comparative Analysis of All Models**
   - Evaluating and comparing the performance of all models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

6. **Discussion**
   - Analyzing the results and reflecting on the strengths and weaknesses of the models.
   - Discussing potential improvements and the implications of the findings.

## Conclusion

This project showcases the ability to conduct comprehensive data analysis, implement machine learning models, and assess their performance.
The chosen modelsâ€”Logistic Regression, RandomForest, and Support Vector Machine were evaluated and compared in terms of their ability to predict stroke risk based on a combination of health and socio-economic factors.
